# Zero-Trust-Remediation-Projects
Exploring and implementing solutions for Zero Trust remediation, focusing on practical projects to enhance security posture.


## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to structured, actionable Zero Trust remediation projects designed for real-world enterprise environments.

My  mission is to demonstrate and support:

- Enforcement of least privilege access across environments
- Continuous verification of identities, devices, and session context
- Advanced micro-segmentation strategies and conditional access policies
- Automation of threat response and audit-level activity tracking



##  Microsoft Zero Trust Architecture Pillars

This repository aligns with Microsoft's Zero Trust architecture as outlined in the [Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA)](https://aka.ms/mcra), and addresses each of the following Zero Trust pillars:

1. **Identity**  
   Enforce strong authentication and least privilege access (e.g., Entra ID, Conditional Access, PIM).
2. **Endpoints**  
   Monitor and secure endpoints via tools like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Intune.
3. **Applications**  
   Ensure secure app access, with integrated app-based conditional access and risk-based policies.
4. **Data**  
   Protect sensitive data using classification
